# ohwhaley

The goal of `ohwhaley` is to make you smile with a whale! 

## Installation

You can install the development version of ohwhaley from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("elskerae/ohwhaley")
```

## Example

`ohwhaley` contains 1 function, `say()`. When left blank, this will produce a whale pun from a random selection.

```{r example}
library(ohwhaley)
## basic example code
say()
```

Otherwise, you can always tell whaley what to say! For example:

```{r customisable example}
say("purr")
```
